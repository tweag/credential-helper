# Building a Custom Credential Helper Binary in Your Bazel Repository

The default credential helper (`@tweag-credential-helper//:tweag-credential-helper`) supports popular services out of the box. If you need additional providers, consider adding support upstream. However, certain projects require custom helpersâ€”either for unique requirements or because the code cannot be released as open source. In such cases, you can define your own `credential_helper` and `installer` targets in your Bazel workspace. A full example is available under [examples/customized][example].

## Implementing a custom helper for authentication to a service

Implement a `go_library` with a struct that implements the `api.Helper` interface. The interface requires two methods:

```go
Resolver(context.Context) (Resolver, error)
CacheKey(GetCredentialsRequest) string
```

`CacheKey` determines the cache key under which a request is stored. Because some services can share authentication headers across multiple URIs, let your helper return an accurate and efficient cache key.

`Resolver` returns a new `api.Resolver`, which you must also implement for your custom provider:

```go
Get(context.Context, GetCredentialsRequest) (GetCredentialsResponse, error)
```

The `Get` method receives a request containing a URI and returns authentication headers (and optionally an expiration time).

You can find the built-in default implementations under [/authenticate][authenticate]. You can also look at an [example of a custom helper that uses parts of the URL path as an authentication header][example-authenticate].

## Implementing a helper factory

The credential helper supports multiple authentication providers in a single helper binary. The factory function determines which `api.Helper` to use based on the request URI. You can find the default implementation in [github.com/tweag/credential-helper/helperfactory/fallback.FallbackHelperFactory][fallback-helper-factory].

## Registering your helper

Custom helpers need to be registered at program startup to work and be recognized correctly. For this, the `registry.Register` function can be called to add a globally known register (with a unique name) to the registry.
Simply add an `init` function to the package that implements `api.Helper`:

```go
func init() {
	registry.Register("foo", FooHelper{})
}
```

## (Optional) Replace the default in-memory cache

By default, the agent process uses a simple in-memory key-value store to cache credentials. You can provide a custom implementation to persist credentials (on disk, in a database, in a shared key-value store, using a (hardware backed) secure storage, etc.), implement more selective caching (decide what to keep), or perform other custom logic.

Implement a `go_library` with a struct that implements the `api.Cache` interface:

```go
Retrieve(context.Context, string) (GetCredentialsResponse, error)
Store(context.Context, CachableGetCredentialsResponse) error
Prune(context.Context) error
```

`Retrieve` takes a cache key and returns a cached response (or the special error `api.CacheMiss`). `Store` receives a cachable response (including a cache key) and caches it. `Prune` is called by the agent on a schedule to evict expired credentials.

You can find the default implementation in [github.com/tweag/credential-helper/cache.MemCache][memcache] and review an [example of a custom cache implementation that uses SQLite to persist credentials][example-sqlite].

## Putting it all together

Add a `BUILD.bazel` file containing the following template and replace values as needed:

```starlark
load("@tweag-credential-helper//bzl:defs.bzl", "credential_helper", "installer")

# This is an example for creating your own, custom credential helper
credential_helper(
    name = "custom_credential_helper",
    # Set `cache` to a `go_library` that implements `api.Cache` and a
    # function of type api.NewCache to construct it.
    cache = "//helper/cache",
    cache_type_name = "NewCustomCache",
    # Set `helperfactory` to a `go_library` that implements `api.HelperFactory`.
    helperfactory = "//helper/helperfactory",
    helperfactory_type_name = "CustomHelperFactory",
    pure = "on",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

# You can invoke the installer using:
#   bazel run //:custom_installer
installer(
    name = "custom_installer",
    credential_helper = ":custom_credential_helper",
)
```

Assuming the Bazel package is in the root of your workspace, you can install your custom helper with this command:

```
bazel run //:custom_installer
```
