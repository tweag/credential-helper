# Cloudflare R2

This document explains how to setup your system for authenticating to R2 using the credential helper.

## Authentication

R2 has an S3-compatible API that requires the creation of special tokens. These are different from normal user tokens and are only used for R2.

- Create an API token by [following the documentation][r2-auth-tokens]
- Set the `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables when running Bazel or other tools

## Configuration

Add to your `.bazelrc`:

```
common --credential_helper=*.r2.cloudflarestorage.com=%workspace%/tools/credential-helper
```
