# AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)

This document explains how to setup your system for authenticating to S3 using the credential helper.

## IAM Setup

In order to access data from a bucket, you need an AWS user- or service account with read access to the objects you want to access (`s3:GetObject`).
Refer to the [AWS documentation][aws-iam] for more information.

## Authentication Methods

### Option 1: Using the AWS CLI and Single Sign On (SSO) as a regular user (Recommended)

- Install the [AWS CLI][aws-install]
- Follow the [documentation][aws-sso-login] for using `aws configure sso` and `aws sso login` to sign in
- Follow the browser prompts to authenticate

### Option 2: Authenticate with other methods

AWS has a lot of ways to authenticate and the credential helper uses the official SDK. If you have more complex requirements, follow the [AWS documentation][aws-sdk-auth] to setup your method of choice.
This may require you to set environment variables when using Bazel (or other tools).

## Configuration

Add to your `.bazelrc`:

```
common --credential_helper=*.amazonaws.com=%workspace%/tools/credential-helper
```

If you want, you can also limit the credential helper to a specific regional endpoint, or virtual-hosted bucket:

```
# only S3 requests for eu-north-1 endpoint
common --credential_helper=*.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com=%workspace%/tools/credential-helper

# only S3 requests for bucket my-bucket in eu-north1
common --credential_helper=my-bucket.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com=%workspace%/tools/credential-helper
```

The configuration in `.tweag-credential-helper.json` supports the following values:

- `.urls[].helper`: `"s3"` (name of the helper)
- `.urls[].config.region`: The AWS region
- `.urls[].config.lookup_chain`: The [lookup chain][lookup_chain] used to find secrets.

In `.tweag-credential-helper.json`, you can use the following secret bindings for the [lookup chain][lookup_chain]:

- `aws-access-key-id`: AWS Access Key ID
- `aws-secret-access-key`: AWS Secret Access Key
- `aws-session-token`: AWS Session Token
- `aws-default-region`: AWS region
- `cloudflare-api-token`: Cloudflare API Token - can optionally be used to derive the secret access key (if secret access key is not provided)

# Troubleshooting

## HTTP 401 or 403 error codes

When using the AWS CLI with SSO, check if you are still authenticated using `aws sts get-caller-identity `.
Then ensure your user has access to the object you are trying to access using `aws s3 cp s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/<OBJECT> ./<OUTPUT_FILENAME>` and check if the credential helper is configured in `.bazelrc`.
